# Chapter 7

Since create a proper and systematic user authenticating system is a tough job, in this chapter we are going to use Django's built-in authenticating system.

Every time a Django project is created, *auth* app is installed as well. Auth app will provide a user object with following fields:

- username
- password
- email
- first_name
- last_name

## LoginView

As we have learned till now, Django provides many views for common use cases. First, we need to update the project's url settings:

```python
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path("accounts/", include("django.contrib.auth.urls")),
    ...
]
```

Next step is to create the related template file. As the `LoginView` documentation notes, by default Django will look within a `templates` directory called `registration` for a file called login.html for a login form. So we need to create a new directory called `registration` and the requisite file within it.

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
<h2>Log In</h2>
<form method="post">{% csrf_token %}
  {{ form.as_p }}
  <button type="submit">Log In</button>
</form>
{% endblock content %}
```

Last step is to tell Django where to redirect user when login is completed. Add this line to your `setting.py`:

```python
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = "home"
```

You can check whether user is logged in or not in your home page template:

```html
{% if user.is_authenticated %}
    <p>Hi {{ user.username }}!</p>
{% else %}
    <p>You are not logged in.</p>
    <a href="{% url 'login' %}">Log In</a>
{% endif %}
```

Furthermore, you can create logout link just by setting logout redirect URL:

```python
LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = "home"
```

## User signup

To implement a user signup functionality, we have to create an app called `accounts`. Now, let's configure the url settings of the project:

```python
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path("accounts/", include("django.contrib.auth.urls")),
    path("accounts/", include("accounts.urls")),
    ...
]
```

Note that the order of `urlpattern` paths matter. Django will read this file from top to bottom and if it does not find one, then it will proceed to another.

Let's create the required signup view:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from django.views.generic import CreateView


class SignUpView(CreateView):
    form_class = UserCreationForm
    success_url = reverse_lazy("login")
    template_name = "registration/signup.html"
```

Why use `reverse_lazy` here instead of `reverse`? The reason is that for all generic class-based views the URLs are not loaded when the file is imported, so we have to use the lazy form of reverse to load them later when theyâ€™re available.

Let's create the template file as well:

```python
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
<h2>Sign Up</h2>
<form method="post">{% csrf_token %}
  {{ form.as_p }}
  <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
</form>
{% endblock content %}
```

And finally let's set up the URLs in account's app URL settings:

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import SignUpView

urlpatterns = [
    path("signup/", SignUpView.as_view(), name="signup"),
]
```
